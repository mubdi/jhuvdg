## Organization
The archive is sorted into a number of directories:
* [jupyternotebooks/](https://github.com/mubdi/vdg-archive/tree/master/jupyternotebooks) : Jupyter Notebooks that can be downloaded and run from various How-To Sessions
* [pdf/](https://github.com/mubdi/vdg-archive/tree/master/pdf) : PDF documents that are particularly useful
